# Test gate ledger

Full-workspace release gates that were DEFERRED under the scoped-first policy
(AGENTS.md, "Scoped-first test gating"). Each pending entry is backfilled by
one consolidated `cargo v8-test` + the no-default-features check; entries the
run covers are then removed.

## Pending

(none)

## Backfilled

- 2026-09-27: backfill executed at HEAD `38f6f84`,
  `cargo nextest run --release --features render --no-fail-fast --config
  vendor/v8-source.toml` = **2000/2000 passed** (4 skipped), plus
  `cargo check -p obscura-js -p obscura-cli --no-default-features --config
  vendor/v8-source.toml` (clean). Covers every pending entry below this line
  as it stood before this run (the 09-23 through 09-27 batches, whose full
  gates were deferred), the 09-27 `__bootstrap` working-tree batch committed
  as `c606d18`, and two push-driven fixes from today: `eb0c3ce` (render:
  cfg-gate the paint-only timing probes and the retained engine binding --
  the pre-push hook's default-feature render shape had rotted; default
  372/372, paint 609/609 scoped) and `38f6f84` (worker: dispatch the
  stashed in-poll batches before the post-poll drain -- the root cause of
  the "pre-existing" worker ordering flakes: a reply posted between the
  in-poll collect and the post-poll `drain_worker_messages` overtook the
  stashed batch, reordering onmessage; the two flaky round-trip tests now
  pass 20/20 standalone). The push-hook gate re-runs the
  js/browser/cdp/render suites at push time. Obstacle course still
  outstanding (the `obscura-benchmark` companion repo is absent on this
  host).

- 2026-09-27: backfill executed, `cargo nextest run --release --features
  render --no-fail-fast --config vendor/v8-source.toml` = **1996/1996
  passed** (1 leaky, 4 skipped) at HEAD `c9d0b62`, plus `cargo check -p
  obscura-js -p obscura-cli --no-default-features --config
  vendor/v8-source.toml` (passes). Covers the two 2026-09-27 deferred
  entries below (`ee49993`/`30db16b`/`1827851`/`468b490` and `098b72e`) and
  `c9d0b62` (worker async-op settle + digest throughput regression tests).
  Event-loop semantics were probed for that batch; no engine change shipped.
  Obstacle course still outstanding for the covered batches and for
  `c9d0b62`: the `obscura-benchmark` companion repo is absent on this host.
- 2026-09-23: backfill executed 13:58, `cargo nextest run --release
  --features render --no-fail-fast --config vendor/v8-source.toml` =
  **1925/1925 passed** (1 leaky, 4 skipped) at HEAD d4a5352. Ledger clear.
- 2026-09-22: baseline. All code commits through `280cf2b` carried full
  workspace gates inside their batches (latest: 1914/1914 at the batch-41
  fix `f12dee4`; `6ac3488`/`280cf2b` are docs-only). Ledger starts empty.

## Deferred

- 2026-09-27: obstacle course only (full workspace gate covered by the
  backfill above) for `ee49993` `30db16b` `1827851` `468b490`, `098b72e`,
  and `c9d0b62`. The `obscura-benchmark` companion repo is absent on this
  host, so the run has to happen where it is checked out.
